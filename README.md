### TODO

**Logout**
- create logout button on menu
- add functionality in user service

**Searching:**

**Generate Report:**
- Individual Project
- Overall Project

**Dashboard:**
- Num of proj
- Upcoming deadlines
- Recent projects
- etc.

bugs:
- project view show scroll bar on first open, following are not (fixed - removed all components then re-initialize all child components)
- task board scroll bar not showing (fixed - dynamically updating viewport whenever a task is added)

future optimizations:
- word wrap on task cards (currently only wraps for two lines)
